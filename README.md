# PyLoad
I'm a video editor so I tend to download videos from youtube a lot. So I decided to make this Youtube Video Downloader so that I could stop using shady websites.

# Installation

- Git clone this repository

- Runs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Core/
python3 main.py
```

# Known Issues

- The app freezes for a second during the downloading process. But the videos download just fine. Working on adding multithreading to solve this.

- Minor UI bugs.

# Updates

- Added the option of download audio files only using the Pafy library.
- Execute the main.py file on PyLoad/Core using "py main.py".
- (If you're using Python 3.11.1 use python main.py)
