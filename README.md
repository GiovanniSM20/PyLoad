# PyLoad
I'm a video editor so I tend to download videos from youtube a lot. So I decided to make this Youtube Video Downloader so that I could stop using shady websites.

# Installation

- Git clone this repository

- Open the pyload.py file in your desired IDE.

- Change the path you want your videos downloaded at lines 20 and 27.

- Execute the script in your terminal using python pyload.py and It's ready to use.

# Known Issues

- The app freezes for a second during the downloading process. But the videos download just fine. Working on adding multithreading to solve this.

- Minor UI bugs.

# Updates

- Added the option of download audio files only using the Pafy library.
